                The decorated ceilings of the Natural History Museum in South
                Kensington, London, were designed by the museum's architect
                Alfred Waterhouse, and were unveiled at the building's opening
                in 1881. The ceiling of the large Central Hall (pictured)
                consists of 162 panels, 108 of which depict plants considered
                significant to the history of the museum, to the British Empire
                or to the museum's visitors. The remaining 54 are highly
                stylised decorative botanical paintings. The ceiling of the
                smaller North Hall consists of 36 panels, 18 of which depict
                plants growing in the British Isles. Both ceilings make
                extensive use of gilding for visual effect. Built of lath and
                plaster to save costs, the ceilings are unusually fragile and
                require extensive maintenance and restoration. Since 2016 the
                skeleton of a blue whale has been suspended from the ceiling of
                the Central Hall.
